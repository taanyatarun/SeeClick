 ********************************** 



GPT-4 is a new generative pre-trained Transformer, or GPT, model made by OpenAI. It is the successor to GPT-3, and is much larger and more powerful. GPT-4 has 175 billion parameters, 10x the number of GPT-3, and is trained on 45TB of text data. It can generate text that is more diverse and coherent than GPT-3, making it better suited to applications such as summarization, translation, and question-answering. GPT-4 also has the potential to dramatically improve natural language understanding and machine learning, allowing machines to understand and interact with humans in a more natural way.
